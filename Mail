Subject: Request for Opinion on Handling CSV Data with Invalid or Null Values

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your input on a situation we are currently facing regarding the data we receive from the database team.

As part of our data processing workflow, we import data from a CSV file provided by the database team into our desired format. However, during this process, we have noticed that approximately 10% of the records are lost due to invalid or null values in the dataset.

In light of this issue, we are seeking your perspective on how to proceed. We have two potential options:

Share All Data: We can continue to share all the data, including records with invalid or null values. This approach ensures that we do not omit any information, but it may require additional efforts to clean and validate the data on the receiving end.

Share Valid Data Set: Alternatively, we can share only the valid data set, excluding records with invalid or null values. This approach simplifies data processing but may result in a loss of information.

We value your expertise and insights on this matter. Please let us know your opinion on which option would be more suitable for our project, or if you have any alternative suggestions.

Your input will greatly assist us in making an informed decision on how to handle this data effectively. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
